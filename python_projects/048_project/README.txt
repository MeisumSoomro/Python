Requirements:
------------
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Required Python packages:
   - scapy
   - matplotlib
   - pandas
   - seaborn

Installation:
------------
1. Install required packages:
   pip install scapy matplotlib pandas seaborn

Features:
--------
1. Packet Capture
   - Real-time packet sniffing
   - Multiple protocol support
   - Interface selection

2. Protocol Analysis
   - TCP/UDP/ICMP detection
   - HTTP/HTTPS identification
   - DNS traffic analysis

3. Traffic Statistics
   - Protocol distribution
   - IP address tracking
   - Port usage monitoring
   - Packet size analysis

4. Visualization
   - Protocol distribution plots
   - Traffic volume graphs
   - Packet size histograms

Classes:

   - Protocol type definitions
   - Traffic categorization
   - Protocol constants

2. NetworkAnalyzer
   - Packet capture engine
   - Traffic analysis
   - Statistics generation
   - Data visualization

Protocols:
---------
1. TCP/IP
   - Connection tracking
   - Port monitoring
   - Traffic flow analysis

2. Application Layer
   - HTTP/HTTPS detection
   - DNS query analysis
   - Service identification

3. Network Layer
   - IP address tracking
   - ICMP monitoring
   - Routing analysis

Usage:
-----
1. Run the program:
   python network_traffic_analyzer.py

2. Main Operations:
   - Start/stop capture
   - View statistics
   - Generate plots
   - Export data

3. Analysis Features:
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Historical analysis
   - Traffic patterns

Important Notes:
--------------
1. Permissions:
   - Root/Admin rights needed
   - Network access required
   - Interface permissions

2. Performance:
   - CPU usage varies
   - Memory requirements
   - Storage considerations

3. Security:
   - Network access control
   - Data privacy
   - Traffic filtering

4. Data Storage:
   - Statistics persistence
   - Log management
   - Plot exports

Troubleshooting:
--------------
1. Common Issues:
   - Permission denied: Run as admin
   - Interface error: Check network
   - Memory error: Reduce capture time

2. Performance Issues:
   - High CPU usage: Limit capture
   - Storage space: Clear old data
   - Network load: Adjust filters
